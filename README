GNFOView
--------

GNFOView is a simple GTK application for viewing NFO files

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.nfo

Installation
------------
This program requires Mono to run.  It is also useful if you have the 
Lucida Console font installed.  You can obtain this from 
http://home.online.no/~aageli/luconP.ttf

Compilation
-----------
This program was written under the MonoDevelop environment and this is 
the most efficient way of compiling it.  It is possible to compile using 
the command line however.  I've included the MonoDevelop solution and 
project files to make life easier, although there may be some embedded 
paths in there that I'm too lazy to tidy up!
